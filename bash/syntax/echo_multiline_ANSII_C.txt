While writing up some testing arounf with getopts and setting globals inside
a function calling getopt, i figured out some things about multi-line shit
with the echo command.



# in case handling opt from getopts
a) 
	echo "IN A BLOCK - "
	arg_file=$OPTARG

	# '\' allows for the multiline code, it also adds a ' ' with echo.
	# Unless noted later, unknown if this applies to the string syntax
	# in general
	echo -e "optarg: $OPTARG\n"\
		"arg_file: $arg_file"
