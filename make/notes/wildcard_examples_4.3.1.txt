Wildcards can be used in the recipe of a rul, where they are expanded by the
shell.

Example - expanded by shell because in recipe

clean:
	rm -f *.o

------

This is a wildcard in a prerequisite of a rule.
In this example, 'make print' will print all the '.c' files
- that have changed since the last time you printed them -

print: *.c
	lpr  -p $?

/* Look at man for lpr and note what $? does in make (or shell probably?)  */

-- what $? does --
page 131

$? is the names of all the prerequisites that are newer than the target,
with spaces between them.
	If target doesnt exist, all prerequisites will be included.
	Works for archives too, example in docs.

Basically, print being the target, *.c being the prerequisites for the target,
$? is an automatic variable wich is the name of all the .c files with spaces
between the names.
