make manual: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.pdf

started from section 6.3.1

looked into this from the basic_makefile line of code
:
SRCS=$(wildcard ./src/*.c) # $(wildcard ../shared/src/*.c)
OBJS=$(SRCS:.c=.o)
:

# -- Substitution References --
'$(var:a=b)' == '${var:a=b}'

A substitution reference subsitutes the value of a variable with alterations
that are specified.

The syntax's ($(var:a=b)) meaning is to take the value of variable var, and
replace every a at the end of a word with b in var's value then substitute
in the resulting string.

"At the end of a word" means that a must appear either followed by a whitespace
or at the end of the value to be replaced, otherwise no alteration to a will
occur.

- example
  foo := a.o b.o l.a c.o
  bar := $(foo:.o=.c)

  result: bar is = a.c b.c l.a c.c

Above syntax for a substituation reference is shorthand for using patsubst to
do the replacement. The equivalence is shown below:

'$(var:a=b)' is equiv to '$(patsubst %a,%b,var)'

Both ways to do the substitution are provided in make for compatibility with
other implementations of make.
