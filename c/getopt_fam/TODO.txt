-- getopt global --
- write a script that calls and runs the tests for each getopt family example
  - The pass check should be in the scripts this one calls for each of the
	examples

- makefile to build each example and run/clean/etc either all at once or
  individually.
  - the makefile will run the test program/script for the make run option.
  - probably figure out a way to include valgrind and gdb or something.


--- getopt() ---
  - makes sure all cases with example is written (like optstrs)
	- Test call cases, make a test script in bash
	  - find a way to nicely make sure all test cases produced the expected
		result and report ones that did not occur.
