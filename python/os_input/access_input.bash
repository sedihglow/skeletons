xinput stuff for now

goal is to enable and disable inputs into the laptop
- possibly also include background keystrokes to re-enable
  - possibly have this called in a calling program
- check out signals in general at some point with bash
- possible utilize xinput?
- reference script might be useful?

- maybe, but maybe not if all input is blocked, disable xterm shortcuts and
  place it in fullscreen first maybe if its not already for giggles?
